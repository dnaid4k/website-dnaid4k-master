json server -  live server is needed for this project
This is my portfolio website.Site will be upgraded using frameworks and libraries and i will put it on my linkedin/github so potential employer may look at it or people that seek for some project to be done or help.
I have used html css js and package json in creation of this website.

Worth paying attention are elements like:
Hamburger menu that goes to the top of screen when website reaches width bigger than 1024px.
Loading circle bars that start to load when section is reached.
Active menu that highlights the name of section that user is actually looking at and links that works with extra underlines.
Experience section that displays data from json file.
Dark mode that is made using js and makes change on class by adding .dark to it by clicking that button.

Website is mobile first and adapted for bigger screens using media queries. Content is orginsed using the same classes for different sections
